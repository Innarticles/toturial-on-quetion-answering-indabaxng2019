# Toturial on Quetion answering IndabaX Nigeria 2019
Hands-on tutorial on Closed-domain question answering on limited datasets - Supervised 
http://indabax.org.ng

### Main Objective 
- Our core aim is to drive the home the intuitions behind the way modern language datasets are passed into ML systems - As an excercise, we aim to derive our own way of representing words and sentences as vectors. Then, we explored state-of-the-art techniques using word embeddings such as Word2Vec 
- With the above understanding, build a simple logistics classifier that predicts and answer based on a given question. Classifier was trained on very limited datasets (26 question answer pairs)
- Word vectors is created uisng [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)


### Further improvements 
- To capture semantic similarities between words, it would be great to have the words presentation from an existing language models. This will help the model generalize with synonyms and anologies etc used in test question.
